      <description>Null safety is the solution to the billion doller mistake and it&amp;rsquo;s available for Flutter as well, why live with billion doller mistake anymore!
As null safety is available with Flutter 2.0 It comes with pretty handy migration guide and can simply use the tool to migrate to null safety nicely.
But in reality it&amp;rsquo;s not that straight forward as it sounds for a medium to big projects, also there might be lots of third party dependencies and tool may produce lots of compile error (atleast it happened with me).</description>

      <description>The Simple answer is to make our life easier, for details keep reading!
I work at a start-up. And like any other start-up, it has that typical start-up workload and crazy requirements that we need to meet along with
 Faster Delivery . Lack of resources. Frequent feature request. Experimental features. And off-course, technical debt.  we have two codebases for two platforms (Android, iOS) written in Objective-C, Java and partially(new features) Kotlin and Swift.</description>

      <description>When it comes to choose any architecture, design pattern or this kind of similar kinds of things it always comes down to preference, choice, need and applicable scenario and most of the writings ends with up with a solution that is very confusing, and most of the cases pros and con, applicable scenario aren&amp;rsquo;t described. Here I&amp;rsquo;m trying to describe a bit according to my little research and knowledge.

      <description>After the first release Flutter is being too obvious to avoid it, lots of people are talking about flutter, and the technology behind it is interesting enough to check out. I liked how it performs(a lot faster than other cross-platform competitors), documentation is also good, so I decided to give it a try. But I&amp;rsquo;m not fully satisfied with the installation procedure, You have to read a few paragraphs to just install but that could have been done through Homebrew / APT / Nuget or whatever(any other package manager) However unofficially it is possible to install Flutter through Homebrew on Mac.</description>
